        The Dynamic Websites â€“ Server-side programming topic is a series of modules that show how to 
        create dynamic websites; websites that deliver customised information in response to HTTP requests. 
        The modules provide a general introduction to server-side programming, along with specific 
        beginner-level guides on how to use the Django (Python) and Express (Node.js/JavaScript) web 
        frameworks to create basic applications.

        Most major websites use some kind of server-side technology to dynamically display data as required. 
        For example, imagine how many products are available on Amazon, and imagine how many posts have been 
        written on Facebook. 
        Displaying all of these using different static pages would be extremely inefficient, so instead such 
        sites display static templates (built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), and then dynamically update 
        the data displayed inside those templates when needed, such as when you want to view a different 
        product on Amazon.
        
        In the modern world of web development, learning about server-side development is highly recommended.

        Learning pathway
        Getting started with server-side programming is usually easier than client-side development, because 
        dynamic websites tend to perform a lot of very similar operations (retrieving data from a database and 
        displaying it in a page, validating user-entered data and saving it in a database, checking user 
        permissions and logging users in, etc.), and are constructed using web frameworks that make these and 
        other common web server operations easy.
        
        Basic knowledge of programming concepts (or of a particular programming language) is useful, but not 
        essential. Similarly, expertise in client-side coding is not required, but a basic knowledge will help 
        you work better with the developers creating your client-side web "front end".

        Modules
        This topic contains the following modules. You should start with the first module, then go on to one 
        of the following modules, which show how to work with two very popular server-side languages using 
        appropriate web frameworks. 

        Server-side website programming first steps
        This module provides technology-agnostic information about server-side website programming such as 
        "what is it?", "how does it differ from client-side programming?", and "why is it useful?". This 
        module also outlines some of the more popular server-side web frameworks and gives guidance on how 
        to select the best one for your site. Lastly, an introduction to web server security is provided.
        Django Web Framework (Python)
        Django is an extremely popular and fully featured server-side web framework, written in Python. The 
        module explains why Django is such a good web server framework, how to set up a development environment 
        and how to perform common tasks with it.
        Express Web Framework (Node.js/JavaScript)
        Express is a popular web framework, written in JavaScript and hosted within the node.js runtime 
        environment. The module explains some of the key benefits of this framework, how to set up your 
        development environment and how to perform common web development and deployment tasks.

        Node server without framework
        This article provides a simple static file server built with pure Node.js, for those of you not 
        wanting to use a framework.
        Properly configuring server MIME types
        Configuring your server to send the correct MIME types (also known as media types or content types) 
        to browsers is important for browsers to be able to properly process and display the content. It is 
        also important to prevent malicious content from masquerading as benign content.
